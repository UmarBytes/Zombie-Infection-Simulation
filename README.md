Completed By: Muhammad Umar Farooq
Role in Project: Academic Collaboration

Project Introduction
This project models a Zombie Infection outbreak using Cellular Automata, implementing both serial and parallel computing environments to simulate infection dynamics. The project simulates infection scenarios, analyzes performance speed-ups, and evaluates population outcomes under various conditions.

Project Features
Parallel and Serial Simulations: Implementations for both serial and parallel simulations using Pthreads.
Infection Simulation: Simulates infection dynamics using the Cellular Automata model, where each cell represents a susceptible, infected (zombie), or removed individual.
Performance Analysis: Provides speed-up comparisons between parallel and serial simulations.
Visualization: Visualizes the grid at various time steps and saves it for further analysis.
Technology Stack
C: Programming language used for the implementation of the simulation.
Pthreads: Used for parallelizing the simulation to speed up the process by utilizing multiple threads.
Matplotlib (via Python): Used for visualizing the simulation results and generating images from the grid data.
Files Details
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key files in the project:

zombie_serial.c:
Functionality: Contains the code for the serial version of the zombie infection simulation. It simulates the infection process in a single-threaded manner, updating the grid based on neighboring cell states.

zombie_parallel.c:
Functionality: Implements the parallel version using Pthreads, where the grid rows are divided among multiple threads, and synchronization is handled using barriers.

viz.py:
Functionality: Visualizes the grid data for different days of the simulation. It loads the grid state from text files and generates corresponding images for each day, saving them as PNG files for later review.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for day in range(0, 100, 10):
    data = np.loadtxt(f'grid_day_{day}.txt')
    plt.imshow(data, cmap='viridis')
    plt.title(f'Day {day}')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.savefig(f'Visualization_day_{day}.png')
    plt.close()
Zombie Infection Using Cellular Automata.pdf:
Functionality: Contains the detailed project documentation, including the abstract, system architecture, flowcharts for both serial and parallel simulations, pseudo-code, and performance analysis.

Zombie Infection Using Cellular Automata.docx:
Functionality: Provides a similar documentation overview, including system design, project specifications, and implementation details for both serial and parallel models.
